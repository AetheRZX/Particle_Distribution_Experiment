# Introduction
It has been noted from previous experiment, that the amount of particles and intensity are correlated. In particular, assuming even distribution, the relationship between number of particles and intensity can be nicely fitted with an equation of the form

$$
\text{I} = a(1 - e^{b \cdot N})
$$

Where:
- I is Intensity
- N is the number of particles
- a, b is some constant
In this experiment, particles will be redistributed and we hypothesizes that the intensity should remain relatively constant.
