# Black Particles - White Background
In this experiment, the particles are seen as black in camera. The setup used here is different, regardless since we are looking at the difference in pixel intensity we expect to see the same overall behaviour with the White Particles from Fig 3.

## Intensity Result
The same test are then 10 times with different particle density, the result of the 10 trials are plotted below.

We can similarly see that the intensity stay relatively constant, again signifying that moving the particles will not affect the intensity by much. Below is the result of the 3 standard deviation of each set.

The standard deviation is much lower compared to the white particles. This is likely the result of using a much bigger imaged area since the camera used here has higher resolution. The low standard deviation is reasuuring for the result of the experiment. It should be noted that the negative mean is the trial where no particles are being tapped, that is the same plate pictured 10 times. We can therefore conclude that the error are withing the error range of the camera.

## Randomness Result
Similiarly with white particles, performing SIFT also yields us low number of matches. Which confirms that the particles are randomly distributed.
